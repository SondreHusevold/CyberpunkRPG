                    <p>Unless you have taken a Mortal Wound, your character is in no danger of dying; he only needs to make his initial Stun save to remain conscious. But if the wound is a MORTAL one, he has a chance of dying.</p>
                    <p>Determining whether he survives requires that a Death Save be made, with a new save required every turn that the character remains untreated.</p>
                    <p>Like a Stun Save, a Death Save requires that you roll a value on 1D10 equal to or lower than your characterâ€™s Body Type score, 
                        subtracting the level of severity for the wound from your base chance to save. Mortal Wounds are rated from O to 8.
                    </p>
                    <div className={styles.ExampleBorder}>
                        <span>Hargan is Very Strong and takes a Mortal 4 wound. He must roll lower than (10-4)=6 to stay alive.</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>Each turn, you must make another Death Save to see if you survive to the next turn. On a successful roll, you make it; on a failed roll, you will die at the end of the turn in which the roll was made.</p>
                    <p>Sooner or later, you'll fail a roll and die. The only way out is</p>
                    <h2>Stabilization:</h2>
                    <p>Stabilization means the patient is no longer losing blood and that his major damage has been contained through use of drugs, battlefield surgery and/or wound dressing.</p>
                    <p>A stabilized character will no longer be required to make Death Saves each turn. Anyone (except the patient himself) can attempt to stabilize a mortally wounded character; it just works better if the physician has had some medical training. A lot better.</p>
                    <p>A successful stabilization is made by adding your TECH stat, any Medical Skill and one D10 for a result equal to or higher than the total number of damage points the patient has taken. </p>
                    <div className={styles.ExampleBorder}>
                        <span>Ripperjack has taken 20 points of damage, placing him in a Mortal 1 Wound State. To stabilize him will require a roll of 20 or greater. Once stabilized, the character is no longer in danger of dying unless another wound is taken. At this point, the whole messy business begins again...</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>The chances of a successful stabilization roll can be increased by the following modifiers, added to your die roll.</p>
                    <table>

                    </table>
                    <p>Assuming you make your stabilization rolls, you're going to survive to fight again. If you fail, no problem, that's why we have Body banks. </p>
