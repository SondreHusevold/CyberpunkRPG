In determining your willingness to fight on despite wounds or your fighting ability under fire, Cool (CL) is essential.\nIt is also the measure of how “together” your character is and how tough he appears to others. Rockerboys and Fixers should always have a high Cool, with Solos and Nomads having the highest of all."

Your luck represents how many points you may use each game to influence the outcome of a critical event.\nTo use Luck, you may add any or all of the points of luck a character has to a critical die roll (declaring your intention to use Luck before the roll is made) until all of your Luck stat is used up.\nLuck is always restored at the end of each game session."

The higher your Movement Allowance (MA), the more distance you can cover in a turn.\nRUN: To determine how far your character can run in a single combat round (@3.2 seconds) in meters, multiply your MA by 3. The character can run three times this distance in a full 10 second turn.\nLEAP: To determine how far your character can leap (from a running start), divide your RUN by 4."

In a world of alienated, future-shocked survivors, the ability to be “human” can no longer be taken for granted.\nEmpathy (EM) is critical when leading, convincing, seducing or perceiving emotional undercurrents. Empathy is also a measure of how close he/she is to the line between feeling human being and cold blooded cyber-monster (see pg. 73 in rulebook for details)."

There are two types of saves in Cyberpunk:\nStun Saves: When you take damage in Cyberpunk, or have been exposed to knockout drugs, you will be required to make a Stun Save. If you fail a Stun Save, you will automatically be knocked out of combat and be unable to recover until you can make a successful Stun Save in a following combat turn. You may make one Save roll every turn until you succeed.\nDeath Saves: When you have been Mortally Wounded (see Trauma Team), or when you have encountered certain types of poisons, you will need to make a Save against Death. On a failed roll, you're Body Bank fodder."

Remember: for every 10 points of Humanity lost, you will automatically lose 1 point of EMP.\nThis can have a serious effect on any Empathy related Skills, as well as forcing you to the edge of cybernetic-induced psychosis."
