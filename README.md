# CyberpunkRPG
Site containing information for the upcoming Cyberpunk 2020 RPG. 

Designed by myself and coded from scratch. 

Also a perfect way to learn React, Create-React-App, patterns, state management and more. Tried to make it minimal without too many extra libraries, packages or CSS helpers like bootstrap. 

It is hosted here: https://sondrehusevold.github.io/CyberpunkRPG/
